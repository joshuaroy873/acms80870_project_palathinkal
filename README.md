This repo is to study the path loss (PL) modelling for radio systems working in the CBRS band (3550-3700 MHz).
For this, measurements were collected using smartphones (also called user-equipments (UEs)), and these measurements are analyzed to extract received signal strenght measures.
As expected, the measurements are not perfect, and cleaning process needs to be performed before using it to statistical model path loss.
